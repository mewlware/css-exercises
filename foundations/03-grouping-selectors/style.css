/* the .buttons class
was added due to a simple question
"Does grouping selectors affect specitifity?"
Especially in the way The Odin Project explained it,
since it's based on "number of selectors", it
can be implied that having two selectors grouped meant
that the number of selectors for those styles are increased.
Alas, that doesn't seem to be the case, as whether the .buttons
or .one, .two classes that are applied is based on where the .buttons
is written - hence it seems this is based on rule order, not specitifity.

It can then be assumed that the "number of selectors" rule
only apply to how many selectors are combined together,
not how many selectors applying the same style individually
